# anomalydetector
A rudimentary anomaly detector I built as part of my internship with Clytics [Summer 2017].


This specific script focuses on highlighting energy data where comanies may face frequent fluctuations in voltage / power outages to analyse trend models based on whether or not the events occur on a weekday or weekend.
